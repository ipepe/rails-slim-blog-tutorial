# rails-slim-blog-tutorial
My attempt at creating rails blog tutorial with slim templating. I can be found here: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

# goals
I will go through whole tutorial, to remind myself how to handle views in rails.

Later when I will finish tutorial i plan to:
 * slug names for urls for articles
 * hook scss bootstrap
 * font-awesome
